## About Wire Admin ##

**Privacy is a right!**  

In a world where digital privacy is being eroded more and more, 
I strongly believe everyone should have the ability to protect their 
own online presence. The awesome WireGuard protocol by Jason A. Donenfeld
is a critical piece of that puzzle.

Wire Admin is a project created to give individuals and 
organisations an easy way to self-host their own WireGuard VPNs. 
This project is free, open, and intended as a gift to the community, 
empowering you to take control of your privacy rather than relying 
on centralised and commercial VPN services.  

My hope is that Wire Admin helps people reclaim their digital freedom safely, 
responsibly, and without compromise.

## How You Can Use It

- Install and run it on your own server.
- Share it with others.
- Use it commercially **if you host it yourself**.

## Important Note About SaaS Hosting

If you run Wire Admin as a public service for paying customers (SaaS), 
the AGPL license requires you to provide source access to your users. 
This ensures improvements remain open and the software continues 
to benefit the community. I hope this project empowers self-hosted 
VPNs rather than enabling commercial services that profit silently 
from my work.

This software is provided freely. 
You may use, modify, and share it for yourself or your organisation. 
If you host it as a public service (SaaS), please respect the AGPL 
license by providing source access to your users.

It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but comes 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

**I hope everyone uses this to empower self-hosted VPNs and take back
control of their own data.**
